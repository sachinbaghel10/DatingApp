# DatingApp
Have you learnt the basics of ASP.NET Core and Angular?  Not sure where to go next?  This project  should be able to help with that. In this DatingApp we start from nothing and incrementally  build up our API and Angular front end until we have a fully functional  Web Application that we then publish to IIS and a Linux server.
